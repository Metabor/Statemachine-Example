Statemachine-Example
====================

Implementation of the [metabor/statemachine](https://github.com/Metabor/MetaborStd)

The example from my talk is in the namespace Example and the slides (in german) in the docs directory.

As a starting point I recommend the index.php

graph.php visualize the process.
The two processes can be called with a parameter:
graph.php?process=prepayment
graph.php?process=postpayment

In the namespace MetaborStd are abstract types defined.
These are exemplified implemented in the namespace Metabor.
